# State management
###########################################################
# This context class is used to share data between handlers. It is automatically injected
# inside the `State` object that can be imported from the shared library.
# The `State` object will allow to access to the context class defined below via the `context`
# attribute as well as other information and helpers for the current request such has the
# operation name.
#
# We force the operation handlers to be defined as syncronous or asyncronous functions, taking in
# input the input structure and the state from the shared library and returning the output structure
# or raising one error from the the shared library.
#
# Examples:
#   * def operation(input: OperationInput, state: State) -> OperationOutput
#   * async def operation(input: OperationInput, state: State) -> OperationOutput
#
# Synchronization:
#   Instance of `Context` class will be cloned for every worker and all state kept in `Context`
#   will be specific to that process. There is no protection provided by default,
#   it is up to you to have synchronization between processes.
#   If you really want to share state between different processes you need to use `multiprocessing` primitives:
#   https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes

# Event streams
############################################################
# An event stream is an abstraction that allows multiple messages to be sent asynchronously
# between a client and server. Event streams support both duplex and simplex streaming.
# You can find more details about event streaming in Smithy Spec:
# https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/streaming.html#event-streams
#
# Event streams modeled as asynchronous Python generators, that means:
# For receiving, you can use `async for` to iterate incoming events from the client and you can
# `break` from the loop if you want to stop receiving events.
# For sending, you can use `yield` to sent an event to the client and you can `return` from your
# generator function to stop `yield`ing events.
#
# Event streams also has a concept of "Modeled Errors" and those events are considered as
# terminal errors and they stop the event stream. They are modeled as exceptions in Python.
# Incoming event streams can raise modeled exceptions to terminate the event stream and you can
# catch those errors by wrapping incoming streams in a `try-except` block, and you can also raise
# a modeled error to terminate event stream.
# See Smithy Spec for more information about modeled errors:
# https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/streaming.html#modeled-errors-in-event-streams
#
# Depending on your use case, your functions usually should look like:
#
# Receiving only:
# ```python
# def receiving(input: Input) -> Output:
#     # Initial message handling...
#
#     async def events(input):
#         try:
#             async for event in input.events:
#                 # Handle incoming `event`...
#                 # `input.events` will gracefully stop if client stops sending events,
#                 # you can also `break` if you want to stop receiving
#         except YourModeledError as err:
#             # Handle modeled error...
#             # The stream is terminated
#
#     # Return immediately and let your generator run in background,
#     # you can also have initial messages and send them here
#     return Output(events=events(input), initial="value")
# ```
#
# Sending only:
# ```python
# def sending(input: Input) -> Output:
#     # Initial message handling...
#
#     async def events(input):
#         while True:
#             # You can send values by `yield`ing them...
#             yield some_value
#
#             # You can just `break` the loop to stop sending events gracefully
#             if some_cond:
#                 break
#
#             # You can also stop sending events by raising modeled errors
#             if some_other_cond:
#                 raise YourModeledError(...)
#
#     # Return immediately and let your generator run in background,
#     # you can also have initial messages and send them here
#     return Output(events=events(input), initial="value")
# ```
#
# Both receiving and sending:
# ```python
# def bidirectional(input: Input) -> Output:
#     # Initial message handling...
#
#     async def events(input):
#         try:
#             async for event in input.events:
#                 # Handle incoming `event`...
#                 # `input.events` will gracefully stop if client stops sending events,
#                 # you can also `break` if you want to stop receiving
#
#                 # Send some event to the client by `yield`ing them, or stop sending events
#                 # by `break`ing the loop or raising modeled errors
#                 yield outgoing
#         except YourModeledError as err:

#
#     # Return immediately and let your generator run in background,
#     # you can also have initial messages and send them here
#     return Output(events=events(input), initial="value")
