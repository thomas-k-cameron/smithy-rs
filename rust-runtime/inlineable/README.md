# aws-inlineable

This is not a "real" crate, but instead a collection of Rust files which can be automatically copied into generated
SDKs. This exists to facilitate writing complex snippets of code that can be tested with normal testing machinery
without needing to create and publish an entire additional crate.

This crate is part of the [AWS SDK for Rust](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-sdk-rust/) and the [smithy-rs](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-rs) code generator. In most cases, it should not be used directly.
