                The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`], which exposes one method for each API
                offered by $serviceName. The return value of each of these methods is a "fluent builder",
                where the different inputs for that API are added by builder-style function call chaining,
                followed by calling `send()` to get a [`Future`](std::future::Future) that will result in
                either a successful output or a [`SdkError`](crate::error::SdkError).

                Some of these API inputs may be structs or enums to provide more complex structured information.
                These structs and enums live in [`types`](crate::types). There are some simpler types for
                representing data such as date times or binary blobs that live in [`primitives`](crate::primitives).

                All types required to configure a client via the [`Config`](crate::Config) struct live
                in [`config`](crate::config).

                The [`operation`](crate::operation) module has a submodule for every API, and in each submodule
                is the input, output, and error type for that API, as well as builders to construct each of those.

                There is a top-level [`Error`](crate::Error) type that encompasses all the errors that the
                client can return. Any other error type can be converted to this `Error` type via the
                [`From`](std::convert::From) trait.

                The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
