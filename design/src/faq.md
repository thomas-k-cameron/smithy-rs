# Design FAQ

## What is Smithy?

Smithy is the interface design language used by AWS services. `smithy-rs` allows users to generate a Rust client for any
Smithy based service (pending protocol support), including those outside of AWS.

## Why is there one crate per service?

1. **Compilation time:** Although it's possible to use cargo features to conditionally compile individual services, we
   decided that this added significant complexity to the generated code. In Rust the "unit of compilation" is a Crate,
   so by using smaller crates we can get better compilation parallelism. Furthermore, ecosystem services like `docs.rs`
   have an upper limit on the maximum amount of time required to build an individual crateâ€”if we packaged the entire SDK
   as a single crate, we would quickly exceed this limit.

2. **Versioning:** It is expected that over time we may major-version-bump individual services. New updates will be pushed
   for _some_ AWS service nearly every day. Maintaining separate crates allows us to only increment versions for the
   relevant pieces that change. See [Independent Crate Versioning](./rfcs/rfc0012_independent_crate_versioning.md) for
   more info.

## Why don't the SDK service crates implement `serde::Serialize` or `serde::Deserialize` for any types?

1. **Compilation time:** `serde` makes heavy use of [several crates](https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive/1.0.136/dependencies)
   *(`proc-macro2`, `quote`, and `syn`)* that are very expensive to compile. Several service crates are already quite large
   and adding a `serde` dependency would increase compile times beyond what we consider acceptable. When we last checked,
   adding `serde` derives made compilation 23% slower.

2. **Misleading results:** We can't use `serde` for serializing requests to AWS or deserializing responses from AWS because
   both sides of that process would require too much customization. Adding serialize/deserialize impls for operations has
   the potential to confuse users when they find it doesn't actually capture all the necessary information (like headers and
   trailers) sent in a request or received in a response.

In the future, we may add `serde` support behind a feature gate. However, we would only support this for operation `Input`
and `Output` structs with the aim of making SDK-related tests easier to set up and run.

## I want to add new request building behavior. Should I add that functionality to the `make_operation` codegen or write a request-altering middleware?

The main question to ask yourself in this case is _"is this new behavior relevant to all services or is it only relevant to some services?"_

- **If the behavior is relevant to all services:** Behavior like this should be defined as a middleware. Behavior like this is often AWS-specific and may not be relevant to non-AWS smithy clients. Middlewares are defined outside of codegen. One example of behavior that should be defined as a middleware is request signing because all requests to AWS services must be signed.
- **If the behavior is only relevant to some services/depends on service model specifics:** Behavior like this should be defined within `make_operation`. Avoid defining AWS-specific behavior within `make_operation`. One example of behavior that should be defined in `make_operation` is checksum validation because only some AWS services have APIs that support checksum validation.

_"Wait a second"_ I hear you say, _"checksum validation is part of the AWS smithy spec, not the core smithy spec. Why is that behavior defined in `make_operation`?"_ The answer is that that feature only applies to some operations and we don't want to codegen a middleware that only supports a subset of operations for a service.
