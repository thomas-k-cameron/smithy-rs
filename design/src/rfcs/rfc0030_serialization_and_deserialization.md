RFC: Serialization and Deserialization
=============

> Status: RFC
>
> Applies to: Output, Input, and Builder types as well as `DateTime`, `Document`, `Blob`, and `Number` implemented in `aws_smithy_types` crate.

# Terminology
- Builder
 Refers to data types prefixed with `Builder`, which converts itself into a corresponding data type upon being built. e.g. `aws_sdk_dynamodb::input::PutItemInput`.
- serde
  Refers to `serde` crate.
- `Serialize`
  Refers to `Serialize` trait avaialble on `serde` crate.
- `Deserialize`
  Refers to `Deserialize` trait available on `serde` crate.


# Overview
We are going to implement Serialize and Deserialize traits from `serde` crate to some data types.
Data types that are going to be affected are;
- builder data types
- operation `Input` types
- operation `Output` types
- data types that builder types may have on their field(s)
- `aws_smithy_types::DateTime`
- `aws_smithy_types::Document`
- `aws_smithy_types::Blob`
- `aws_smithy_types::Number`

`DateTime` and `Blob` implements different serialization/deserialization format for human-readable and non-human readable format; We must emphasize that these 2 formats are not compatible with each other. The reason for this is explained in the [Blob](#blob) section and [Date Time](#datetime).

Additionally, we add `fn set_fields` to fluent builders to allow users to set the data they deserialized to fluent builders.

Lastly, we emphasize that this RFC does NOT aim to serialize the entire response or request or implement `serde` traits on data types for server-side code.

# Use Case
Users have requested `serde` traits to be implemented on data types implemented in rust SDK.
We have created this RFC with the following use cases in mind.
1. [[request]: Serialize/Deserialize of models for Lambda events #269](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/issues/269)
2. [Tests](https://smithy-lang.github.io/smithy-rs/design/faq.html#why-dont-the-sdk-service-crates-implement-serdeserialize-or-serdedeserialize-for-any-types) as suggested in the design FAQ.
3. Building tools

# Feature Gate

## Enabling Feature
To enable any of the features from this RFC, user must pass `--cfg aws-sdk-unstable` to rustc.

You can do this by specifying it on env-variable or by config.toml.

- specifying it on .cargo/config.toml

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "aws-sdk-unstable"]
```

- As an environment variable

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS="--cfg aws-sdk-unstable"
cargo build
```

We considered allowing users to enable this feature on a crate-level.

e.g.
```toml
[dependencies]
aws_sdk_dynamodb = { version = "0.22.0", features = ["unstable", "serialize"] }
```

Compared to the cfg approach, it is lot easier for the users to enable this feature.
However, we believe that cfg approach ensure users won't enable this feature by surprise, and communicate to users that features behind this feature gate can be taken-away or exprience breaking changes any time in future.

## Feature Gate for Serialization and De-serialization
`Serde` traits are implemented behind feature gates.
`Serialize` is implemented behind `serde-serialize`, while `Deserialize` is implemented behind `serde-deserialize`.
Users must enable the `unstable` feature to expose those features.

We considered giving each feature a dedicated feature gate such as `unstable-serde-serialize`.
In this case, we will need to change the name of feature gates entirely once it leaves the unstable status which will cause users to make changes to their code base.
We conclude that this brings no benefit to the users.

Furthermore, we considered naming the fature-gate `serialize`/`deserialize`.
However, this way it would be confusing for the users when we add support for different serialization/deserialization framework such as `deser`.
Thus, to emphasize that the traits is from `serde` crate, we decided to name it `serde-serialize`/`serde-deserialize`

## Keeping both features behind the same feature gate
We considered keeping both features behind the same feature gate.
There is no significant difference in the complexity of implementation.
We do not see any benefit in keeping them behind the same feature gate as this will only increase compile time when users do not need one of the features.

## Different feature gates for different data types
We considered implementing different feature gates for output, input, and their corresponding data types.
For example, output and input types can have `output-serde-*` and `input-serde-*`.
We are unable to do this as relevant metadata is not available during the code-gen.


# Implementation
## Smithy Types
`aws_smithy_types` is a crate that implements smithy's data types.
These data types must implement serde traits as well since SDK uses the data types.

### Blob
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` is not implemented with derive macro.

In human-readable format, `Blob` is serialized as a base64 encoded string and any data to be deserialized as this data type must be encoded in base 64.
Encoding must be carried out by `base64::encode` function available from `aws_smithy_types` crate.
Non-human readable format serializes `Blob` with `fn serialize_bytes`.

- Reason behind the implementation of human-readable format

`aws_smithy_types` crate comes with functions for encoding/decoding base 64, which makes the implementation simpler.
Additionally, AWS CLI and AWS SDK for other languages require data to be encoded in base 64 when it requires `Blob` type as input.

We also considered serializing them with `serialize_bytes`, without encoding them with `serialize_bytes`.
In this case, the implementation will depend on the implementation of the library author.

There are many different crates, so we decided to survey how some of the most popular crates implement this feature.

| library    | version | implementation  | all-time downloads on crate.io as of writing (Dec 2022) |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| serde_json | 1.0     | Array of number | 109,491,713                                              |
| toml       | 0.5.9   | Array of number | 63,601,994                                               |
| serde_yaml | 0.9.14  | Unsupported     | 23,767,300                                               |

First of all, bytes could have hundreds of elements; reading an array of hundreds of numbers will never be a pleasing experience, and it is especially troubling when you are writing data for test cases.
Additionally, it has come to our attention that some crates just doesn't support it, which would hinder users' ability to be productive and tie users' hand.

For the reasons described above, we believe that it is crucial to encode them to string and base64 is favourable over other encoding schemes such as base 16, 32, or Ascii85.

- Reason behind the implementation of a non-human readable format
We considered using the same logic for non-human readable format as well.
However, readable-ness is not necessary for non-human readable format.
Additionally, non-human readable format tends to emphasize resource efficiency over human-readable format; Base64 encoded string would take up more space, which is not what the users would want.

Thus, we believe that implementing a tailored serialization logic would be beneficial to the users.


### DateTime
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` is not implemented with derive macro.
For human-readable format, `DateTime` is serialized in RFC-3339 format;
It expects the value to be in RFC-3339 format when it is Deserialized.

Non-human readable implements `DateTime` as a tuple of `u32` and `i64`; the latter corresponds to `seconds` field and the first is the `seubsecond_nanos`.

- Reason behind the implementation of a human-readable format

For serialization, `DateTime` format already implements a function to encode itself into RFC-3339 format.
For deserialization, it is possible to accept other formats, we can add this later if we find it reasonable.

- Reason behind the implementation of a non-human readable format

Serializing them as tuples of two integers results in a smaller data size and requires less computing power than any string-based format.
Tuple will be smaller in size as it does not require tagging like in maps.

### Document
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` is implemented with derive macro.
Additionally, it implements container attribute `#[serde(untagged)]`.
Serde can distinguish each variant without tagging thanks to the difference in each variant's datatypes.

### Number
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` is implemented with derive macro.
Additionally, it implements container attribute `#[serde(untagged)]`.

Serde can distinguish each variant without a tag as each variant's content is different.

## Builder Types and Non-Builder Types
Builder types and non Builder types implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` with derive macro.

Example:
```rust,ignore
#[cfg_attr(
    all(aws-sdk-unstable, feature = "serialize"),
    derive(serde::Serialize)
)]
#[cfg_attr(
    all(aws-sdk-unstable, feature = "deserialize"),
    derive(serde::Deserialize)
)]
#[non_exhaustive]
#[derive(std::clone::Clone, std::cmp::PartialEq)]
pub struct UploadPartCopyOutput {
  ...
}
```

## Enum Representation
`serde` allows programmers to use one of four different tagging ([internal, external, adjacent, and untagged](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html)) when serializing an enum.
### untagged
  You cannot deserialize serialized data in some cases.
  For example, [aws_sdk_dynamodb::model::AttributeValue](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-dynamodb/latest/aws_sdk_dynamodb/model/enum.AttributeValue.html) has `Null(bool)` and `Bool(bool)`, which you cannot distinguish serialized values without a tag.


### internal
  This results in compile time error.
  [*Using a #[serde(tag = "...")] attribute on an enum containing a tuple variant is an error at compile time*](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html).

### external and adjacent
We are left with `external` and `adjacent` tagging.
External tagging is the default way.
This RFC can be achieved either way.

The resulting size of the serialized data is smaller when tagged externally, as adjacent tagging will require a tag even when a variant has no content.

For the reasons mentioned above, we implement an enum that is externally tagged.

## Data Types to Skip Serialization/Deserialization
We are going to skip serialization and deserialization of fields that have the datatype that corresponds to `@streaming blob` from smithy.
Any fields with these data types are tagged with `#[serde(skip)]`.

By skipping, corresponding field's value will be assigned the value generated by `Default` trait.

As of writing, `aws_smithy_http::byte_stream::ByteStream` is the only data type that is affected by this decision.

Here is an example of data types affected by this decision:
- `aws_sdk_s3::input::put_object_input::PutObjectInput`

We considered serializing them as bytes, however, it could take some time for a stream to reach the end, and the resulting serialized data may be too big for itself to fit into the ram.

Here is an example snippet.
```rust,ignore
#[allow(missing_docs)]
#[cfg_attr(
    all(aws-sdk-unstable, feature = "serde-serialize"),
    derive(serde::Serialize)
)]
#[cfg_attr(
    all(aws-sdk-unstable, feature = "serde-deserialize"),
    derive(serde::Deserialize)
)]
#[non_exhaustive]
#[derive(std::fmt::Debug)]
pub struct PutObjectInput {
    pub acl: std::option::Option<crate::model::ObjectCannedAcl>,
    pub body: aws_smithy_http::byte_stream::ByteStream,
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Data types to exclude from ser/de code generation
For data types that include `@streaming union` in any of their fields, we do NOT implement `serde` traits.

As of writing, following Rust data types corresponds to `@streaming union`.
- `aws_smithy_http::event_stream::Receiver`
- `aws_smithy_http::event_stream::EventStreamSender`

Here is an example of data type affected by this decision;
- `aws_sdk_transcribestreaming::client::fluent_builders::StartMedicalStreamTranscription`

We considered skipping relevant fields on serialization and creating a custom de-serialization function which creates event stream that will always result in error when a user tries to send/receive data.
However, we believe that our decision is justified for following reason.
- All for operations that feature event streams since the stream is ephemeral (tied to the HTTP connection), and is effectively unusable after serialization and deserialization
- Most event stream operations don't have fields that go along with them, making the stream the sole component in them, which makes ser/de not so useful
- SDK that uses event stream, such as `aws-sdk-transcribestreaming` only has just over 5000 all-time downloads with recent downloads of just under 1000 as of writing (2023/01/21); It makes it difficult to justify since the implementation impacts smaller number of people.


## `Serde` traits implemented on Builder of Output Types
Output data, such as `aws_sdk_dynamodb::output::UpdateTableOutput` has builder types.
These builder types are available to users, however, no API requires users to build data types by themselves.

We considered removing traits from these data types.

Removing serde traits on these types will help reduce compile time, however, builder type can be useful, for example, for testing.
We have prepared examples [here](UseCaseExamples).

## `fn set_fields` to allow users to use externally created `Input`

Currently, to set the value to fluent builders, users must call setter methods for each field.
SDK does not have a method that allows users to use deserialized `Input`.
Thus, we add a new method `fn set_fields` to `Client` types.
This method accepts inputs and replaces all parameters that `Client` has with the new one.

```rust,ignore
pub fn set_fields(mut self, input_type: path::to::input_type) -> path::to::input_type {
    self.inner = input_type;
    self
}
```

Users can use `fn set_fields` to replace the parameters in fluent builders.
You can find examples [here](#UseCaseExamples).

# Other Concerns
## Model evolution
SDK will introduce new fields and we may see new data types in the future.

We believe that this will not be a problem.

### Introduction of New Fields
Most fields are `Option<T>` type.
When the user de-serializes data written for a format before the new fields were introduced, new fields will be assigned with `None` type.

If a field isn't `Option`, `serde` uses `Default` trait unless a custom de-serialization/serialization is specified to generate data to fill the field.
If the new field is not an `Option<T>` type and has no `Default` implementation, we must implement a custom de-serialization logic.

In the case of serialization, the introduction of new fields will not be an issue unless the data format requires a schema. (e.g. parquet, avro) However, this is outside the scope of this RFC.

## Introduction of New Data Type
If a new field introduces a new data type, it will not require any additional work if the data type can derive `serde` traits.

If the data cannot derive `serde` traits on its own, then we have two options.
To clarify, this is the same approach we took on `Data Type to skip` section.
1. skip
   We will simply skip serializing/de-serializing. However, we may need to implement custom serialization/de-serialization logic if a value is not wrapped with `Option`.
2. custom serialization/de-serialization logic
   We can implement tailored serialization/de-serialization logic.

Either way, we will mention this on the generated docs to avoid surprising users.

e.g.
```rust,ignore
#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct OutputV1 {
  string_field: Option<String>
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct OutputV2 {
  string_field: Option<String>,
  // this will always be treated as None value by serde
  #[serde(skip)]
  skip_not_serializable: Option<SomeComplexDataType>,
  // We can implement a custom serialization logic
  #[serde(serialize_with = "custom_serilization_logic", deserialize_with = "custom_deserilization_logic")]
  not_derive_able: SomeComplexDataType,
  // Serialization will be skipped, and de-serialization will be handled with the function provided on default tag
  #[serde(skip, default = "default_value")]
  skip_with_custom: DataTypeWithoutDefaultTrait,
}
```
# Discussions

## Sensitive Information
If serialized data contains sensitive information, it will not be masked.
We mention that fields can compromise such information on every struct field to ensure that users know this.

## Compile Time
We ran the following benchmark on C6a.2xlarge instance with 50gb of GP2 SSD.
The commit hash of the code is a8e2e19129aead4fbc8cf0e3d34df0188a62de9f.

It clearly shows an increase in compile time.
Users are advised to consider the use of software such as [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) or [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) to reduce the compile time.

## Misleading Results
SDK team previously expressed concern that serialized data may be misleading.
We believe that features implemented as part of this RFC do not produce a misleading result as we focus on builder types and it's corresponding data types which are mapped to serde's data type model with the derive macro.

# Appendix
## [Use Case Examples](UseCaseExamples)
```rust,ignore
use aws_sdk_dynamodb::{Client, Error};

async fn example(read_builder: bool) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // getting the client
    let shared_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = Client::new(&shared_config);

    // de-serializing input's builder types and input types from json
    let deserialized_input = if read_builder {
      let mut parameter: aws_sdk_dynamodb::input::list_tables_input::Builder = serde_json::from_str(include_str!("./builder.json"));
      parameter.set_exclusive_start_table_name("some_name").build()
    } else {
      let input: aws_sdk_dynamodb::input::ListTablesInput = serde_json::from_str(include_str!("./input.json"));
      input
    };

    // sending request using the deserialized input
    let res = client.list_tables().set_fields(deserialized_input).send().await?;
    println!("DynamoDB tables: {:?}", res.table_names);

    let out: aws_sdk_dynamodb::output::ListTablesOutput = {
      // say you want some of the field to have certain values
      let mut out_builder: aws_sdk_dynamodb::output::list_tables_output::Builder = serde_json::from_str(r#"
        {
          table_names: [ "table1", "table2" ]
        }
      "#);
      // but you don't really care about some other values
      out_builder.set_last_evaluated_table_name(res.last_evaluated_table_name()).build()
    };
    assert_eq!(res, out);

    // serializing json output
    let json_output = serde_json::to_string(res).unwrap();
    // you can save the serialized input
    println!(json_output);
    Ok(())
}
```
